My Advent of code solving functions written in C.

I am using my custom get_new_line function in order to interact with text file that includes list of puzzle input. 

1) Put your puzzle input inside of corresponding txt file.

2) Compile the c file together with advent_utils.c - "gcc advent_day1_1 advent_utils && ./a.out"
